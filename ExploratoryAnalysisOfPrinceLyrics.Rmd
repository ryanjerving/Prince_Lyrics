## Intro

This is a project based on the DataCamp tutorial by Debbie Liske, "Lyric Analysis with NLP & Machine Learning with R," @ <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/R-nlp-machine-learning>

The project aims to demonstrate three things:

* Text mining with R tidyverse tools
* Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and natural language processing (NLP)
* Predictive analytics using machine learning tools

## Loading Libraries and Data Sets

First, we'll import any libraries needed to do these tasks, then pull in the `csv` that Liske created with Prince's lyrics, release year, and Billboard position for each song.

```{r load-libraries-and-data, message = FALSE, results= 'hide'}

# most of the libraries needed

library(dplyr) #data manipulation
library(ggplot2) #visualizations
library(gridExtra) #viewing multiple plots together
library(tidytext) #text mining
library(wordcloud2) #creative visualizations

# now the data, preventing R from converting strings to factors

prince_orig = read.csv("https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/prince_raw_data.csv", 
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

## Intial Exploration

Let's see what the column headings are:

```{r explore-names, message = FALSE}

names(prince_orig)

```

From these, we'll only need row number `X`, the lyrics (`text`), `song` title, `album` title, release `year`, and `peak` Billboard, `US.Pop`, and `US.R.B` variables.

```{r selected-desired-columns}

# Select desired columns, renaming when it would help to do so

prince <- prince_orig %>%
  select(lyrics = text, song, year, album, peak,
         us_pop = US.Pop, us_rnb = US.R.B)

# Check out the size of this table. We know we have 7 dimension columns: how many rows?

dim(prince)

# That's 824 songs!

# And take a transposed glimpse of a sample track:

selectedSongRow = which(prince$song == 'international lover')

glimpse(prince[selectedSongRow, ])

# And lyric:

str(prince[selectedSongRow, ]$lyrics, nchar.max = 300)

```

## Cleaning and Transforming Data

Now, let's work with this dataset to condition it for analysis.

We'll create a function using `gsub()` to replace contractions across the corpus, along with another function to preserve only alphanumeric characters, and then converting all text to lowercase.

```{r contraction-and-removal}

# Function to expand contractions in an English-language source

fix.contractions <- function(doc) {
  doc <- gsub("won't", "will not", doc)
  doc <- gsub("can't", "can not", doc)
  doc <- gsub("n't", " not", doc)
  doc <- gsub("'ll", " will", doc)
  doc <- gsub("'re", " are", doc)
  doc <- gsub("'ve", " have", doc)
  doc <- gsub("'m", " am", doc)
  doc <- gsub("'d", " would", doc)
  # we'll leave "'s" alone since it could also be possessive
  doc <- gsub("'s", "", doc)
  return(doc)
}

# Apply this function to the Prince lyrics corpus

prince$lyrics <- sapply(prince$lyrics, fix.contractions)

# Function to remove special characters, using a regular expression for alphanumeric chars only

removeSpecialChars <- function(x) gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", " ", x)

# ... and applied to lyrics

prince$lyrics <- sapply(prince$lyrics, removeSpecialChars)

# Convert all characters to lowercase.

prince$lyrics <- sapply(prince$lyrics, tolower)

```

Let's see what we've got.

```{r display-cleaned}

# Look at a bit of a sample song again ("Controversy")

str(prince[selectedSongRow, ]$lyrics, nchar.max = 300)

# And let's also see what we can about the full set: 37 years of songs between 1978 and 2015, with the lowest charting (highest number) song entering at 88.

summary(prince)

```

Now, we'll add a `decade` variable in order to provide some "bucket" by which to distinguish a logical grouping of songs for comparisons (using dplyr's `mutate()` function). We'll do the same for a `chart_level` variable to show whether a song reached the top 100 or top 10 (and a `charted` yes/no variable for whether it cracked the top 100 at all).

```{r add-variables}

# Add decade bucket variable

prince <- prince %>%
  mutate(decade =
          ifelse(prince$year %in% 1978:1979, "1970s",
          ifelse(prince$year %in% 1980:1989, "1980s",
          ifelse(prince$year %in% 1990:1999, "1990s",
          ifelse(prince$year %in% 2000:2009, "2000s",
          ifelse(prince$year %in% 2010:2015, "2010s",
          "NA"))))))

# Add chart-level bucket variable

prince <- prince %>%
  mutate(chart_level =
           ifelse(prince$peak %in% 1:10, "Top 10",
           ifelse(prince$peak %in% 11:100, "Top 100",
           "Uncharted")))

# Add charted variable to show whether it charted or not

prince <- prince %>%
  mutate(charted =
           ifelse(prince$peak %in% 1:00, "Charted",
           "Uncharted"))

```

This will be our basic dataset for use here. And since we might want to use this work for something else later, let's save it as a csv file for reference.

```{r write-to-file}

write.csv(prince, file = "prince_new.csv")

```

## Descriptive Statistics

To start visualizing and analyzing what we've got, we'll work with Debbie Liske's preferred color scheme for creating plots.

```{r color-scheme}

# define color scheme

dl_colors <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#CC79A7", "#D55E00")

# ...and a function for how we'll handle the display

theme_lyrics <- function()
{
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")
}

```

We'll start by taking a look at songs by decade (filtering out blank "NA" values for years).

```{r songcounts-by-decade}

prince %>%
  filter(decade != "NA") %>%
  group_by(decade, charted) %>%
  summarise(songCounts = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = decade, y = songCounts, fill = charted), stat = "identity")


```
